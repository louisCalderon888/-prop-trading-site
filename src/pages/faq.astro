  {
    question: "What is the best promo code for Apex Trader Funding in 2026?",
    answer: "The best Apex Trader Funding promo code is OTBAOPUX, which provides up to 80% off evaluations and 50% off resets. This code is verified daily."
  },
  {
    question: "How do getting funded with a prop firm work?",
    answer: "First, you purchase an evaluation account (using a promo code). Second, you trade to reach a profit target while adhering to risk rules like drawdown. Third, once you pass, you sign a contract and receive a funded account."
  },
  {
    question: "Which prop firms allow high-frequency trading (HFT)?",
    answer: "Most futures prop firms (Apex, TopStep, Bulenox) prohibit HFT strategies that abuse the sim environment. However, firms like Quantower or specific HFT-friendly evaluations may exist, but standard accounts restrict it."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a trailing drawdown?",
    answer: "A trailing drawdown is a risk rule where the minimum account balance increases as your open or closed profit increases. It trails your highest equity peak. It never goes back down, making it a critical rule to monitor."
  },
  {
    question: "Are prop trading promo codes legit?",
    answer: "Yes, but they expire often. We manually verify checks every 6 hours. Codes marked with 'Exclusive' or 'Verified' on our site are guaranteed to work at the time of the last check."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use NinjaTrader for free with prop firms?",
    answer: "Yes. When you sign up for an evaluation, the prop firm provides a license key (often multi-broker) that allows you to use NinjaTrader for free during the evaluation and funded stage."
